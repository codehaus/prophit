BlockDiagram is currently rendered by :

orbit.gui.tower.TowerDiagramWireFrame
orbit.gui.tower.TowerDiagramSolid

Both have similar behavior, in that they set up a CallLayoutAlgorithm and BlockRenderer, then run it
MapFrame always renders the TowerDiagramWireFrame, then renders the TowerDiagramSolid if 
		 RENDER_SOLID is enabled and wireFrame mode is not enabled

TowerDiagramWireFrame and TowerDiagramSolid re-compute themselves at slightly different times
Since TowerDiagramWireFrame is responsible for rendering wire-frame mode, it has to respond to WIREFRAME_PROPERTY, 
  SELECTED_CALL_PROPERTY and NAME_SEARCH_STRING_PROPERTY events

These classes can be unified into one which just renders the tower diagram as appropriate for the situation.
Or into one class for the non-rotating diagram and one for the rotating one? Or wire-frame mode and the automatic 
  wireframe mode that is enabled when the diagram rotates can be made to be the same
