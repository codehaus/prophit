Want to separate Model/View/Controller for the BlockDiagram

model attributes:
  number of levels to show
  shiftLeft/Right/Up/Down		  
  eye location
  zoom*
  mouseOverCall
  selectedCall
  
controller:
  handle click, click-drag

BlockDiagramView:
  serves as the GL canvas and as the controller
  uses the BlockDiagramModel to contain the stateful information about the diagram
  uses a BlockRenderer and the CallLayoutAlgorithm to render the diagram
  implements scrolling, rotation, and picking
  Should eventually move all the GL code into specialized classes (e.g. labels)
