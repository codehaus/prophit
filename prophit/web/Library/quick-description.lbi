The Orbit user interface uses a dense, color-coded, 3-dimensional <a href="../docs/concepts.html#screenshot">tower 
diagram</a> to present much more information on the screen than the traditional 
tree view. Instead of cluttering the screen, labels and numbers are placed out 
of the way of the data and are made available on demand. Orbit enables you to 
use your powers of visual observation and image analysis to find important features 
of your profile, then provides you with the data you need to improve your programs.
