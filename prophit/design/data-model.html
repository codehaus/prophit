<h1 align="center">prophIt Profile Data Model</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This document describes the Java object model which prophIt uses to represent 
  a profile. This object model is designed to be both lightweight and flexible. 
  It provides a unified API for the data files output by a variety of profilers, 
  and it representeds the profiler data compactly and completely.</p>
<p>The operation of a computer program can be represented as a tree-structured 
  graph. In a single-threaded program, the root of the graph represents the <code>main</code> 
  function of the program. In a multi-threaded program, each child of the root 
  represents the starting function of a separate thread; the root of the graph 
  is just an abstraction used to unify all the threads into one graph. In general, 
  the number of nodes (function calls) in the graph can be very large. Therefore, 
  prophIt does not use a tree of Java objects to store the call graph. Instead, 
  the call graph is constructed on demand as the prophIt GUI (or other API client) 
  navigates through the call graph. The tradeoff is a large savings in space at 
  the cost of some extra computation. The philosophy of the prophIt UI is to only 
  keep in memory what the user is actually looking at on the screen. The user 
  cannot make meaningful sense of thousands or tens of thousands of function calls, 
  therefore there is no reason to keep them all in memory.</p>
<h2>Basic Objects</h2>
<p>The prophIt data model is stored in the Java package <code>orbit.model</code>. 
  The JavaDoc for these classes can be used as a detailed reference for their 
  operation. </p>
<p>Within this package the primary classes are:</p>
<dl> 
  <dt><code>StackTrace</code></dt>
  <dd>Each function call in a profile is associated with a stack trace, which 
    is a partial call stack. prophIt does not generally store the entire stack 
    trace for each function call. This may result in some loss of information, 
    but in general the profilers that produce the data files (<code>-prof</code>, 
    <code>hprof</code>, the Perl profiler) do not capture the entire call stack 
    so in actuality prophIt is not throwing away any information. Here is an example 
    of a stack trace taken from the document <a href="../data/hello.hprof.txt">data/hello.hprof.txt</a>: 
    <pre>
  	TRACE 108:
    java/lang/String.&lt;init&gt;(String.java:471)
    java/lang/StringBuffer.toString(StringBuffer.java:1068)
    util/HelloList.buildAsStrings(HelloList.java:71)
    util/HelloList.linkedAndString(HelloList.java:42)
    util/HelloList.main(HelloList.java:20)
</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt> <code>RCC</code></dt>
  <dd>RCC is an acronym which stands for 'Recorded Caller/Callee'. The term 'Caller/Callee' 
    originally referred to a <code>StackTrace</code> with 2 entries : the caller 
    function and the callee function. Now, Caller/Callee has been genericized 
    to a <code>StackTrace</code> of arbitrary depth, but the class name RCC has 
    not been changed. In any event, an RCC is the combination of a <code>StackTrace</code> 
    with function profiling information. Currently this profiling information 
    consists of an integer key that identifies the RCC, the inclusive time spent 
    in the RCC, and the number of times the RCC was invoked. For the <code>hprof</code> 
    profiler, an RCC can be constructed from each of these lines in the data file: 
    <p> 
    <table cellpad="2" cellspace="2" border="0">
      <tr> 
        <td><b>rank</b></td>
        <td><b>self</b></td>
        <td><b>accum</b></td>
        <td><b>count</b></td>
        <td><b>trace</b></td>
        <td><b>method</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>57</td>
        <td>0.35%</td>
        <td>89.18%</td>
        <td>34</td>
        <td>108</td>
        <td>java/lang/String.&lt;init&gt;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p> Here the 'count' is the number of invocations, 'self' is the inclusive 
      time as a percentage of the total program time, and 'trace' identifies the 
      <code>StackTrace </code>108 which is listed above. 
  </dd>
  <dt><code>CallID</code></dt>
  <dd>A <code>CallID</code> is simply the combination of a caller (parent) RCC 
    with a callee (child) RCC. This combination of parent and child RCC represents 
    a specific function invocation. An RCC alone does not always represent a specific 
    function invocation, because the same stack trace may occur in many places 
    in the call graph. Consider a profile file which contains the following entries:<br>
    <pre>
    Caller        Callee
    ------        ------
    init          executeQuery
    test          executeQuery
    executeQuery  sqlParse
	</pre>
    In this case, the RCC with <code>StackTrace</code> ( executeQuery, sqlParse 
    ) is invoked from two parent RCCs: ( init, executeQuery ) and ( test, executeQuery 
    ). Thus, there will be two CallIDs whose child RCC is ( executeQuery, sqlParse 
    ). When an <code>RCC</code> 'X' does not appear multiple times in the call 
    graph, then the <code>time</code> and <code>ncalls</code> (number of invocations) 
    for that <code>CallID</code> is simply the <code>time</code> and <code>ncalls</code> 
    of its child <code>RCC</code>. When it does appear multiple times in the call 
    graph, then the <code>time</code> and <code>ncalls</code> of the <code>RCC</code> 
    is split among all the <code>CallIDs</code> whose child <code>RCC</code> is 
    'X'. </dd>
