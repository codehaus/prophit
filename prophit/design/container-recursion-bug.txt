Bug : If a call graph contains recursive calls to a method, the inclusive time and caller/callee rollup for that method is not correct

reproduction:
test/java/bugs/SelfCallerHierarchy.java

CallDetails view should display:

For the selected method:
  Sum of the inclusive time of each call that is not a recursive call
  Sum of the exclusive time of each call

Table of callers:
  Each method which is a caller of the selected call somewhere in the call graph
  display : 
    p.caller.name
    p.callee.inclusiveTime
    p.callee.inclusiveTime / sum
  where :
    p = root-most instance of each unique caller-callee pair
    sum = Sum of the inclusive time of p

Table of callees:
  Each method which is a callee of the selected call (root-most instances only)
  display :
    p.callee.name
    p.callee.inclusiveTime
    p.callee.inclusiveTime / sum
